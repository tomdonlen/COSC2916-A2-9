            <h1>Robotics</h1>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Written by Thomas Donlen</p>
            <br>
            <p>Current state of the art robots are used in many different fields worldwide such as  manufacturing, humanitarian aid and surgery. This was not the case 100 years ago when the term robot was coined in a play that represented it negatively. The story presented a doomsday scenario where robots rise up and make humans obsolete. This narrative has consistently carried on throughout the past century, creating an unnecessary sense of fear in those uneducated in the area of robotics. An example of this is James Cameron’s <i>‘The Terminator’</i>[1] which has more recently contributed strongly to this negative portrayal. This shows us the uphill battle that robotics has been facing since that time.</p>
            <p>Robots in their current state are built to do repetitive tasks that fatigue humans easily or tasks that they are physically unable to perform. In a basic sense, they are synthesising an aspect of human function.[2]</p>
            <p>Currently, there is a rover headed to Mars expected to land on the 18th of February in 2021 named Perseverance.[3] This rover’s main purpose is to seek out signs of ancient life and to collect rock and soil samples with the hope of returning them to earth. This robot has many different applications of robotics that can be seen, such as cameras, arms and X-ray instruments made for sampling environment data and determining the chemical composition of mars. It showcases the strengths of using robots in terms of its dexterity, learning, precision, durability and the ability to perform a dangerous task unfit for a human.[4]</p>
            <p>There will continuously be a rise in the focus of creating robotics that help improve the quality of life for people with disabilities and this will put the focus on limb dexterity and real time response.[5] On the commercial side of things, profitability would be the emphasis with a focus on maximizing actions per minute, consistency, adaptivity, durability and cost effectiveness. Because of this, many companies will be investing in robots to increase both their short- and long-term profitability.</p>
            <p>Another key area of progress in robotics has been the integration of Artificial Intelligence in a way that lets a robot function more like a human would. This means tasks that require human knowledge and intelligence may one day be possible with robots such as quality control that currently require people to assess.</p>
            <p>Below are some of the fields that use robotics in both the present time its potential for the future: </p>
            <p>CURRENT ROBOTICS</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Autonomous Vehicles [10]</li>
                <li>Rovers [3]</li>
                <li>Prosthetics [4]</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Fighting</li>
                <li>Astronauts</li>
                <li>Line Work</li>
                <li>Autonomous Vehicles [10]</li>
                <li>Manufacturing</li>
                <li>Medical [11]</li>
                <li>Exoskeletons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With hardware and software becoming more responsive constantly, this progress directly correlates with the improvement of robotic response. With these emerging technologies, scientists and developers can make discoveries that further advance the industry much more rapidly than before. These experiments are often done privately to retain authenticity of the discovery and acknowledgement of their work. This sometimes makes it difficult to tell exactly where the field is heading and what the next big discovery might be.</p>
            <p> Other technologies</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cameras</li>
                <li>Distance</li>
                <li>Force</li>
                <li>Proximity Sensors</li>
                <li>Force Sensors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These developments in the field of robotics will impact everyone in one way or another. Developments like robotic prosthetics will make activities normally only accessible to able bodied people accessible to those who have lost limbs or were born without them. Things like human interaction in some jobs may change, such as manufacturing.[6] We will see the integration of robots more widely adopted among society as the public perception changes from fear to acceptance and willingness to allow robots to help in everyday life. Your local supermarket may do away with human stockers and replace them with robotics. Shopping centre cleaners and janitors may be replaced with autonomous and robotic cleaners. Those affected most will be the people who interact with these robots daily, and those whose jobs are replaced with robots.[7] This means people who do the grocery shopping for example. In terms of job replacement, the hard-labour jobs are the jobs that will be affected first. Jobs like car manufacturing, janitorial jobs, jobs that don’t require a high level of human intuition or eye for detail. Robots will make a lot of jobs redundant, there is no escaping that. However, these robots will need to be developed, produced, sold, maintained, and operated and all those jobs require a human interaction. A study done by research firm, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48760799" target=_blank>Oxford Economics</a>, found a steady increase in use of robots in the automotive sector especially from 2011 to 2016. The study presents the view that the increase in productivity and efficiency that robots bring should boost growth, producing as many jobs as it displaces. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48760799" target=_blank>study</a> also found that for ‘each additional robot installed in lower-skilled regions could lead to as many as twice as many job losses as those in higher-skilled regions’.</p>

            <p>IT jobs it seems will be some of the last jobs to be replaced by robots, as unintuitive as it may seem. IT jobs, software development especially, require lots of troubleshooting which, for a robot is very difficult. Without Artificial Intelligence [8] robots can only perform a task in which it has been programmed to perform. This means that, at least in its current state of development will not be replaced at least. Although this does not mean I will not be affected. Robots have been and will continue to affect the IT sector for the foreseeable future. IT plays a key role in developing and producing robots. Every robot needs to be developed and programmed and, where controlled by a computer, that is all done by IT professionals. In terms of day to day life, I suspect the impact will very be much the same for me as it will the rest of the public. Depending on its actual integration into society, I could potentially see myself interacting with robots daily, which may already be the case for some. Things we do not even think about being robots such as vending machines, automated floor cleaners, drones can all be considered robots. There will also be an impact we do not see firsthand, the way our products are manufactured, how our food is farmed and produced, how our cars are made and how the movies [9] we watch are filmed will all be done solely, or assisted by robots.</p>
