            <p>I came into the group project anxious to see the different kinds of people involved, but this feeling went away after the first meeting. Everyone seemed very open to other people’s thoughts which created a nice positive environment from the first meeting onwards. Even though none of us were very assertive, this openness made it, so everyone got a good word out, and it helped us establish roles early in the project. I was surprised with this since talking about all our project ideas since each one was vastly different from the other, but this might have created an even better group dynamic where people knew their strengths and roles right away. Meeting were great and efficient, and even though a member or two were not able to attend a meeting, they still caught up and did the work on time. In terms of points of improvement, goal setting is the main area since sometimes goals were a bit unclear and not all of them were accounted for from the start. This also ties in with better communication, and with us being more assertive with what we think. However, I have seen improvement in these areas throughout the project and it is likely that our inexperience working with one another affected this as well, so I believe that we as a group are on the right track.</p>

            <p>My initial experience with finding a group was confusing and stressful. However, patience was rewarding and I ended up in a motivated and well-structured group. Everyone was eager to get into the assignment as soon as the group was established. Roles were discussed and meetings scheduled, the bulk of the work was well under way. With no meeting ending short, we managed to communicate much of what we needed to throughout. Updates given, workloads distributed and everyone seemed to be happy with how much they needed to contribute. Each group member completed their work quickly and efficiently. Meetings could happen more often, however with other responsibilities throughout the group, it was hard to. Communication could also be improved on, in terms of where everyone is at with their work, when we can have a meeting, and when work is finalised. This can probably be resolved through more detailed use of the tools we were given. Responsibility for quality of work and referencing can also be improved on. However, I feel that if these are the cons, then the group can evolve into an even stronger unit as time progresses. I look forward to working within this team in further assessment.</p>

            <p>Overall I think our communication was very strong, as was the will in the team to help each other succeed. Differences in both experience and confidence levels was evident, but this was a positive experience, with those who felt less confident voicing so in a safe environment, which was quickly followed by assurances and sharing of information and knowledge. In terms of improvements for next time, an earlier definition of the work required as well as clearer separation of work would assist the group in being more efficient. I also think that having one person to align each of the authored content and website was good in principle, but in practice it bifurcated the time, adding pressure to those writing and those aligning.</p>
            <p>Coming into the group I was nervous from previous negative group assignment experiences and had to work at putting preconceptions aside, but the support this group had for the members within was solid and has genuinely made me more comfortable with working with assignment groups. Given the whole group poll relatively highly on the introvert scale, it did take some time for us all to gather momentum but we have largely found our rhythms and I am confident this will carry on through the next assessment.</p>

            <p>This first project together has had an overarching positive experience after starting with a nervous and anxious feeling going into the project. The group has all contributed in a positive way that will reflect in the standard of work. Sometimes all the members being in the meetings at the same time was difficult but if a meeting was missed by someone, they would make an effort to see what they missed and apologise and would have already notified us in advance. The work ethic was strong in the group and everyone had a strong contribution. I know personally, my standard of work having limited knowledge in information technology would not be the same as others in the group, it was a surprise to me how catering the group was to my individual knowledge. I did not feel there was much to improve on that we have not discussed, perhaps making sure all the members are comfortable on a personable level just as much as a professional level.</p>

            <p>My perception of the group is a positive one. I have enjoyed working with motivated people who are focused on producing great work. I have found the overall attitude in the group to be hard working and humorous. I think that this has helped in creating an environment where we all work well together. This was evident when it came to putting the finishing touches on the website. We took overall direction from Patryk since he was responsible for that portion of the task, but we also discussed specific changes to files and code on the GitHub repository with positive intent and this encouraged contributions from all team members.</p>
            <p>The allocations of work that were decided on in the beginning worked well in the establishment of duties for the assignment. The initial decisions that were made were adhered to by all members and I think this has helped to prevent group members from doubling up on completing tasks. During the work allocation, each member was honest and supportive about their understanding of the IT technologies, meaning that if a member wasn’t confident in their knowledge of the topic, other members would offer assistance.</p>

            <p>Having had poor experiences with group projects in the past, I was unsure of what to expect from this assignment, but I was very pleasantly surprised. As a team we met quickly through teams and went straight into assigning roles and responsibilities. Having set tasks outlined really helps with time management, which is an area I need to work on personally. Returning to study was quite the shock to me and outlined some issues I need to work on. I found myself struggling somewhat with balancing work and study and commitments, which the team was very accommodating to. I was very surprised at how quickly we all gelled and how well we all worked together. I could definitely have improved on my time management and organisational skills to truly feel like I am contributing my best. I perhaps did not communicate as well as I could have as at times, I felt like reaching out and asking for help may have been a sign that I was not good enough or up to the task. Knowing now just how accommodating and understanding the team is has helped make me feel a lot more comfortable asking for assistance with my work.</p>
