            <p>The ideal jobs for the members of Team IceT can be split into two categories, developers and operations.</p>
            <p>IT developers are all similar but the type of development that they conduct is the differentiating factor. Front-End web development, as chosen by Patryk, is the practice of producing the visual elements of a website. They must take in into account how users will interact and comprehend the visible aspects of the websites they design. Web designers use coding languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to produce web site designs and they will typically specialize in one particular coding language or style.</p>
            <p>Peter and Thomas both chose software developer as their ideal job, with Peter paying special attention to game development. Software development, like web development requires an individual understand coding, but instead of focusing on the visual elements of a project, it can include many areas of expertise and overall is a much broader term.</p>
            <p>Software development can be defined as an individual who builds and creates software and applications. It can involve development of back-end systems, debugging code and conceptualising ideas into tangible systems. Game development is closely related to software development, since at a fundamental level, games are software applications.</p>
            <p>The other half of the team can be classified as operations type positions. Meaning that the positions of IT business analyst, cloud operation director and IT support officer all play a part in the function of the organisation they are a part of.</p>
            <p>Austin chose IT business analyst. The description in the advertisement for this position describes the job as a role that is responsible for all IT systems within the company. This ranges from workplace efficiency to IT systems expenditure. The operation of most modern companies depends on reliable IT infrastructure, so the IT business analyst oversees and analyses this section of the company and puts forward recommendations and feedback for improvement.</p>
            <p>An IT business analyst is similar to an IT support officer in the scope of technologies that need to be dealt with, but rather than overseeing the operation, a support officer directly contributes to the operation of the IT systems. IT support officers are responsible for fielding support requests from end users and conducting maintenance on core systems. Communication is a highly valued skill in both positions since communication is vital to the delivery of successful outcomes for both technicians and clients.</p>
            <p>Nathan’s ideal job as a cloud operations director is a prime example of an operations focused position. It requires extensive knowledge of cloud hosted services and solutions, with regards to the operation of these in service to the company. It requires an underlying set of management skills, which aligns with Austin’s IT business analyst position, since the outcomes of the analysation need management to implement change. Overall, the three operations style jobs have some similarities, but they all have distinct differences too.</p>
            <p>There can be a strong divide between the two categories of job that have been outlined. But the IT industry is beginning to understand communication across these divides results in better IT outcomes for businesses. While the primary functions between developers and operations focused workers are vastly different, communication helps to break down the segregation and open opportunities for collaboration.</p>

                    <td>My opinion of my ideal job is unchanged as it is exactly what I expected, however, I would have expected HTML/CSS to be ranked in the data. There is a clear demand for Javascript.</td>

This job has such a spread spectrum or requirements and experience depending on what you are specialising in. Having a portfolio showing understandings of multiple systems would make you more favourable to employers.</td>
                    <td>Even though my job was not in the burning glass data, it did not change my opinion on it since through research I understand that it is a job that ties in all these other jobs together. I am also interested on the business side of things as well.</td>
