            <h1>Clouds, services, and servers</h1>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Written by Liam Sackley-Akacich</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The terms cloud, services and servers are closely related within the IT industry. The cloud is a name that refers to cloud computing, which is a computing model where data is stored and processing is conducted on hardware owned by companies that offer this as a service. This technology has been revolutionary in the IT industry due to the many advantages it offers to personal users and businesses of all sizes.</p>
            <p>A major use of the cloud computing model is cloud storage. Cloud storage is when data is stored on hardware situated in large data centres accessible via the internet. It is a popular option for customers and businesses to utilise due to its ability to offer reliable backup solutions with redundancy and it gives the user or users access to the data from any device with a connection to the internet, and it can be more cost effective than onsite data storage solutions.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing is made available to the public in two main ways. It is either aimed at personal use or business use. Personal cloud computing often includes services that allow easy file sharing and data storage from multiple devices (Foote, 2017). Business cloud computing can be split into a further three categories - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Software as a service (SaaS).</p>
            <p>Infrastructure as a service relates to the hardware needed for computing. Products such as Microsoft Azure or Linode give customers the ability to use the hardware that is hosted in secure data centre facilities for their computing needs (Microsoft Azure, 2020). Companies that offer this usually charge customers for this service based on the resources that they use, meaning that it can be more cost effective compared to paying for a full server that may not be fully utilised on premises. It also creates a situation of shared responsibility and liability. In server environments that use hardware hosted in data centres, the customer is not responsible or liable for the physical hardware, but they are responsible for the software that runs on it. This gives the customer a multitude of benefits when using a cloud hosted IT environment. Since the host is responsible for any hardware faults, the cost of these incidents is not passed onto the customer. IaaS is also a highly scalable service that can grow with a company. For example, if a company was using cloud hosted server hardware and they were to purchase an additional international premises with 50 more employees, they would have the option to expand their cloud hosted systems to accommodate for extra users without the need to install IT hardware at the new location.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Platform as a service is closely related to IaaS, but rather than the customer paying for just the use of infrastructure, they are also purchasing a software platform that can be used in conjunction with the infrastructure, such as development tools or operating systems (Microsoft Azure, 2020). The Google App Engine is an example of this service, in which the customer does not need to manage the infrastructure, but instead are responsible for how the development tools are utilised. It is a product that allows developers to write code and build applications without having to manage the infrastructure that hosts it. The platform allows the use of common coding languages and tools, meaning that the developers only have to contribute the coding aspect of the application and they can rely on a framework that computes the inputs they provide (Google Cloud, 2020). It is similar to IaaS with Microsoft Azure in that developers only pay for the resources that they use. Costs scale with the amount of traffic generated or the total runtime that is used by an application. PaaS has all the underlying benefits of IaaS since all data is hosted in the cloud, and it is accessible via the web.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Software as a service is a type of software that is accessible via the web. It can eliminate the need for installing software locally on a PC since all that is needed is a web browser. The vendor providing the software is responsible for all forms of maintenance, physical infrastructure management and updates. It allows companies and users to rely on the availability and stability of the software that they use. An example of SaaS is Microsoft Office 365. This product offers online access to software in the Office 365 suite such as Outlook, Word and Teams. It also integrates with the installable versions of this software too and allows for greater collaborative capacity within workplaces and industries that use the software. Since all interaction between the user and the SaaS is done via the web, data is stored on the hardware owned by the vendor, and they are responsible for its integrity and availability.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing has been made possible through advancements in virtualisation technology which it heavily relies on. An obvious example of this is in looking at an infrastructure as a service model. If a virtual machine is created in a data centre, it would be running on a physical server that partitions a portion of its compute power for that virtual machine. The server can perform other tasks for other customers such as hosting other virtual machines, but the customer can only interact with what has been provisioned for their virtual machine. If a customer is using the remote infrastructure for a task that requires the computing power of more than one server, the data centre can use their hardware as a compute cluster. This means that the collective power of the hardware can be used for tasks that require high amounts of resources, such as complex big data processing.</p>
            <p>Companies with large onsite networks and server configurations are discovering that the power of cloud computing is becoming essential in reducing expenditure and increasing efficiency for their systems. The use of hybrid server environments for companies that are in the process of moving to the cloud is becoming very popular. Some businesses can have server environments comprised of onsite hardware that runs email, file storage, databases and organisational domains. These configurations can act as a private cloud, only accessible by users on the domain, but they are vulnerable to the pitfalls of on premises hardware ownership. Cloud computing gives these businesses the option of acquiring shared responsibility and liability for their IT systems and server configurations.</p>
            <p>Hybrid cloud computing is a system model that includes cloud hosted configurations that work in conjunction with on-premises hardware. It is a popular option for businesses that are making a slow transition to utilising cloud hosted solutions.</p>
            <p>The impacts that cloud computing has had on society have been massive, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has allowed many businesses that utilise SaaS to continue operating with their employees working from home. Since SaaS is accessible securely via the internet, workers can continue to use the software that they would normally use in the office, but instead use their own devices. Without cloud computing, a larger amount of the workforce would have been prevented from working, and this would have heavily magnified the negative effects on the economy. The experience of COVID-19 is likely to confirm the decisions of some companies that were unsure of the benefits of cloud computing making it more likely that in the future, companies that use on-premises servers will be the minority.</p>
            <p>The shift to cloud computing will also affect the people employed in the IT industry. With less hardware being located onsite, this would mean a decline in onsite infrastructure management which will only need to be worked on by IT technicians. But even if an organisation’s infrastructure is hosted in a data centre, technicians are still needed for configuration, administrative support and software maintenance. It also creates other jobs in IT project management and will force technicians to diversify their knowledge base and adapt to the changing environment of the IT industry.</p>
            <p>The computing power of these large arrays of hardware is driving advancement in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The amount of computing power that is required by the algorithms and calculations done in machine learning can be too much for a single PC or server to handle. Cloud computing helps to offer easily accessible high amounts of data processing power to applications that use artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing is a technology that I use every day, often without even realising, both in my personal life and in my job. An example of cloud computing that I use daily is my personal banking. I bank a company called Up that used cloud hosting for the backend of their banking application. All data and processing is done on Google Cloud hosted solutions (Up 2020). I found that almost all aspects of technology that I interact with daily use cloud computing in one of its many forms. I think the greatest impact of cloud computing has been its accessibility. It has meant that users are not bound to using certain hardware or static methods to access their data, this has allowed society to evolve to using technology in almost everything that is done.</p>
