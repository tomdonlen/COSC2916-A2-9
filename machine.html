            <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Written by Patryk Mroczek and Austin Chua</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Machine learning is the capability of a program to adjust and learn based on previous inputs into the program. This makes it so that a program does not need to be coded manually to improve and evolve. (Expert Systems, 2020) The main concept behind this technology is the behavioral patterns and learning patterns of human beings, since the goal of machine learning is to create programs that can function grow without further human intervention. It is being developed in several different fields such as language, image processing and predictive software which are all designed to be like a human being’s way of thinking. (Toward Data Science, 2020)</p>
            <p>Currently, the most prominent and advanced uses of machine learning is trending towards Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and the ability of an artificial intelligence (AI) to interact through conversations. (Forbes, 2020) All three of these areas are being developed through Reinforcement Learning (RL) which would help an AI develop much quicker and in a much more stable environment since RL is done in order to ensure that these AIs are able to develop properly, and so that researchers are able to learn more about the program’s behavior. (Papers with Code, 2020)</p>
            <p>The developments we see today can mainly be attributed to Computer Vision. The most common examples of the usage of this technology are its uses in images, image classification and image generation. For example, image classification aims through machine learning to identify individual parts of an image. This then allows for the image to be broken down to separate parts to which the computer can classify what is in the actual image. Google reCAPTCHA uses millions of user inputs from image-related tasks to learn how to identify parts of an image. (Google, 2020) Many of us have encountered the dreaded “I’m not a robot” to then be made to select images of buses, signs, etc. This is all assisting Google’s Machine Learning to learn how to identify individual parts of images, to develop image classification.</p>
            <p>This type of learning is significant in assisting in the development of autonomous vehicles. Having the ability to distinguish between vehicles, obstacles, and humans is paramount to the development of self-driving vehicles. Tesla, amongst other companies, is using this kind of machine learning to develop more and more intelligent autonomous vehicles. (Tesla, 2020) Already we can see plenty of evidence of autonomous vehicles driving safely on their own. However, there are some still some obstacles that machine learning has not yet been able to pass.</p>
            <p>The key limitation that machine learning faces in its development is the inability to make correct decisions. Machine learning is yet to be able to solve ethical dilemma, with Phillipa Foot’s Trolley Problem at the forefront of this issue.(AI Trends, 2020) If machine learning is to be prevalent, the lack of morality will need to be addressed. However, that is no easy task since machine learning depends on data mostly sourced through the internet. Microsoft’s Tay Twitter bot managed to start tweeting inappropriate things within 24 hours of its debut. (The Verge, 2016) This is all because it gained its data from reading other user’s tweets.</p>
            <p>The process of developing machine learning is comparable to educating a child. If the child is exposed to the wrong things, they will take it as gospel. Because of this, it’s clear that if machine learning is to develop, the correct data and further development is required. Data will need to be filtered, and in the case of machine learning, that is no simple task as it requires massive amounts of it.</p>
            <p>The following years could see more advanced and complex AIs being developed, but we wouldn’t be able to tell if they are efficient or not. Getting generalizations through learning more about these programs could potentially help researchers find better ways in creating them. These advances in technology have been made possible through Mathematics and Statistics, problem solving, and data collection and analysis are both key in learning.</p>
            <p>Machine learning already has great potential in a great many fields. It Influences most all aspects of our lives including education, medicine, military, and finance. As machine learning develops, it will surely contribute more and more to all aspects of society. Anything that involves problem solving will eventually have machine learning contributing to it. Even today, from simple tasks such as cooking at home, all the way to launching a celestial expedition already has some form of machine learning involved.</p>
            <p>With the assistance of machine learning, our lives will become simplified, as our patterns, wants, needs, are all collected as data. This data will then allow for whatever technology that uses machine learning to produce results and execute tasks that will assist in tasks in day to day life. Whether it be private or professional. Machine learning will become so common in daily life that eventually people will become dependent on it to make day to day life simpler and more efficient, making it harder and harder to do any tasks without it. In terms of socio-economic differences, those who have more of these technologies involved in work or home life will see it impact the most. Lower socio-economic individuals may not see as much of it as machine learning depends on having the technology to control or use it.</p>
            <p>Because of the integration of machine learning in our daily lives, it would greatly impact the job market both positively and negatively. Jobs that used to involve minimal technological knowledge could drastically change, making it so education is greatly affected by this. New jobs that stem from development or maintenance of new technologies could arise, and jobs that can be done with these new technologies could phase out as well.</p>
            <p>The most common impact in the average person's life of machine learning will come from its marriage with autonomous technologies. Households will become autonomous. Any appliance, lighting, heating will most definitely be controlled by it, setting itself to the user’s ideal settings. Shopping will be catered for, as your fridge will collect data on what you consume. Cars, buses, trucks, trains, almost all forms of transport will eventually become controlled by it. This is of course if the issue of ethical processing is addressed.</p>
            <p>(Patryk) My key issue with machine learning will be the level of security and privacy imbedded with the data that will be used for the machine learning. Just as with any kind of data, if this can be stored and sold by the provider, I will be very unlikely to use it. In the case that it’s super secure, eg. Stored on a local server that the machine is located on as well, then I would be more comfortable with using it. In that case, I would most definitely imagine it would assist in my day to day life. I would have to control my finances, budgeting and such, so that I know where and how my spending is being used. That and creating the ideal atmosphere at home with appliances, air-conditioning, lighting and the sort. I would most probably attempt at creating my own applications for it, whether it be a shopbot, or a personal assistant.</p>
            <p>The idea of security again, would depend on how I promote it to my family and friends. I would see it being used by them regardless, particularly my parents, who would definitely use it to their advantage. By the time this sort of technology will become viable, I would see it as a great assistant to my parents in their older age. Organising food delivery, transport, and anything that would have them less out of their way would be a prime application.</p>
